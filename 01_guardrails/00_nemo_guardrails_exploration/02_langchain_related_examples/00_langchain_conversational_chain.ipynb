He studied at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, where he earned a degree in physics. After graduation, he worked as a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland, where he had ample time to pursue his own scientific research.\n",

These papers included his theory of special relativity, which showed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another, and his famous equation E=mc², which showed that mass and energy are interchangeable.\n",

He continued to work on his theory of general relativity, which extended his earlier work to include gravity, and he also made important contributions to the development of quantum mechanics.\n",

He spoke out against war and nuclear weapons, and was a vocal advocate for civil rights and democracy. He emigrated to the United States in 1933 to escape Nazi persecution, and became a citizen in 1940.\n",
