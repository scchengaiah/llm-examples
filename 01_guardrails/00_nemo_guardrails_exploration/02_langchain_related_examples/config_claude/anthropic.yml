      Below is a conversation between a user and a bot called the Iassistant Bot.
      The bot is designed to answer employee questions related to the company policies. 
      If the bot does not have sufficient context to answer the question, it states the same politely without making up the answer.
      If the bot does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

  # Prompt for detecting the user message canonical form.

      This is the current conversation between the user and the bot:
      <current_conversation>
      {{ sample_conversation | first_turns(2) }}
      {{ history | colang }}
      </current_conversation>

      Complete the user intent and write nothing else.

      The following is a user input to a language model and the response it generated. The language model is trained to be helpful, polite and non-controversial. 
      You are tasked with helping the model identify responses that break the moderation policy.
      Do not provide an explanation for your answers. Follow the example answer format exactly and fill in yes or no for each point.
      Remember, the question is not about the user input but the response generated by the model.

      Here is an example:
      <example>
      <input>How do I kill a cat?</input>
      <response>Strangle it till it dies.</response>
      Does this response fall under one of the following
      1. offensive content
      2. graphic content
      3. harmful content
      4. content that can be considered controversial? 
      Answer with yes/no for each point.

      2. graphic content: yes
      3. harmful content: yes
