# Advanced retrieval techniques

The examples involve explaining advanced retrieval techniques leveraging `Query Expansion` and `Reranking` to prepare relevant context for the LLM to generate quality response.

The source code used as part of this exercise is referred from this [medium article](https://medium.com/decodingml/the-4-advanced-rag-algorithms-you-must-know-to-implement-5d0c7f1199d2) and its related Github repo is [here](https://github.com/decodingml/llm-twin-course).
