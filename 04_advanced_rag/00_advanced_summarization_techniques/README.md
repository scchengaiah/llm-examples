# Advanced summarization techniques

LLM's are good at summarization when provided a piece of larger text. The size of the text and the context length supported by the LLM's has an impact on the quality of the summarization performed.

We have several techniques that can be incorporated to improve the summarization that shall be explained in this exploration.

We begin with simple summarization techniques such as followed by the advanced techniques such as `Auto Refinement` and `Multi Document Summarization`.

Refer to the [references](#references) section for related blogs.

## Examples

[Examples.ipynb](./Examples.ipynb) contains consolidated examples for both `Simple summarization techniques` and `Advanced summarization techniques`.

For `Simple summarization techniques` such as `Stuff It` and `Chunk It`, refer to the file [simple_summarize.ipynb](./simple_summarize.ipynb).

For `Advanced summarization techniques` such as `Auto Refinement` and `Multi Document Summarization`, refer to the file [advanced_summarize.ipynb](./advanced_summarize.ipynb).
