# CodePilot

An AI assisted pair programmer built on top of existing frameworks with Agentic workflows for accuracy.

## Roadmap

- Step 1: To identify reliable solution to query code base semantically. Evaluate the retrieval accuracy and improve further.
  - Agentic workflow to validate the retrieved context and re-iterate with different queryset if required.
- Step 2: To use the retrieved context as reference and apply changes to the code.
  - Agentic workflow to determine changes involved and evaluate frameworks such as `aider` can be utilized to perform the changes.
- Step 3: Evaluate and improve the implementation for optimal accuracy.

## Development Progress

We are currently in research phase trying to understand the nuances of searching over a code base to identify and extract relevant code snippets, files based on user query.

**Research activity draft:**

- Semantic Search over a Codebase

  - Setup a working example with decent accuracy to identify the required information from the existing code base.
