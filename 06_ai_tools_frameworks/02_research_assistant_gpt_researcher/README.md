# GPT Researcher

GPT Researcher is an autonomous agent designed for comprehensive online research on a variety of tasks.

The agent can produce detailed, factual and unbiased research reports, with customization options for focusing on relevant resources, outlines, and lessons. Inspired by the recent Plan-and-Solve and RAG papers, GPT Researcher addresses issues of speed, determinism and reliability, offering a more stable performance and increased speed through parallelized agent work, as opposed to synchronous operations.

## Getting started

We have forked the actual Github repo to start setting up the environment. Fork can be found [here](https://github.com/scchengaiah/gpt-researcher-fork).

Have created a [getting-started](https://github.com/scchengaiah/gpt-researcher-fork/tree/getting-started) branch that contains the additional configurations made. All related documentation shall be maintained under `README-Self.md` for further reference.

This [getting-started](https://github.com/scchengaiah/gpt-researcher-fork/tree/getting-started) branch shall be synced from the main branch to receive latest updates.
