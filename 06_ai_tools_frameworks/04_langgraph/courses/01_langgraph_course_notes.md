# Langgraph Course

This document contains notes captured while going through the Langchain academy's [Langgraph course](https://academy.langchain.com/courses/intro-to-langgraph).

The key aspects involved in the notes may undergo significant upgrades as the framework evolves, hence always refer to the latest documentation for updated information.

We have forked the [repository](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-academy) that contains the sample source code and is segregated into various modules.

All our exploration during the course is performed on `learning` branch.
