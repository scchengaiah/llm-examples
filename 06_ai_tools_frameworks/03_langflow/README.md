# Langflow

Langflow is a new, visual framework for building multi-agent and RAG applications. It is open-source, Python-powered, fully customizable, and LLM and vector store agnostic.

Its intuitive interface allows for easy manipulation of AI building blocks, enabling developers to quickly prototype and turn their ideas into powerful, real-world solutions.

Langflow empowers developers to rapidly prototype and build AI applications with its user-friendly interface and powerful features. Whether you're a seasoned AI developer or just starting out, Langflow provides the tools you need to bring your AI ideas to life.

Langflow is open-source and can be run locally and also on Datastax which is a managed service with various integrations on cloud.

## Setup

For learning purpose, we shall try to set langflow in our local environment and explore the capabilities mentioned in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmUsG_3wHPg).

```bash
uv venv
uv pip install langflow
uv run langflow run
```

Launch app and start creating flows. Explored flows can be found [here](./flows/).
