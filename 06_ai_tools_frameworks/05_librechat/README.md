## Local Setup

We have downloaded the repository and made some modifications to run it as a docker container.

This [folder](../05_librechat/) contains the related files and configuration that can be copied to the cloned repository to run the application locally.

>Do note that this configuration might be applicable at the time of writing this documentation and is subjected to changes with new features being added to the repository.

>Also, we have removed the sensitive values from the configuration that needs to be replaced at the time of running the application.

This is the initial configuration that was used to spin up the application. Add or remove the required configuration for advanced usecases such as using Agents and Model Context protocol servers.

Also, this configuration shall be updated with more scenarios as the exploration progresses.
